Here's the demo of Shift Keys 
Hypothesis is,  the user experience for AI is broken.
We’ve spent a king’s ransom on these tools — and they still suck.
The workflow of hopping back and forth to your browser? Laughably bad.
AI should work everywhere a keyboard works.
Not just your browser — but Slack, PowerPoint, Excel, Twitter.
Anywhere you can type, AI should be there.
Driving home last week, this idea came to me
AI should be as simple as copy-paste.
So I built a tool that lives at the OS level.
It works across every app, every domain — no plugins, no tabs.
And it’s dead simple to use.
Just hit both shift keys.
It's its so instinctive, it feels so right 
It's always there, 500milliseconds away
Your fingers never leave the keyboard - don't break train of thought
It’s the AI interface we always should have had 
You can make a single line surgical edit or a whole page rewrite
It carries context in the background, so it remembers between prompts
It's model agnostic, use case agnostic, platform agnostic 
It's so simple it's almost dumb 
Everyone ignored the user experience while chasing AGI
What if we went the other direction?
Nobody cares what's under the hood 
They care about the interface 
Lets define HOW the world uses AI
